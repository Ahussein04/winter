# Sensory Overload

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?

My Partner and I love listening to music. Often you can see on our discord statuses us listening to Spotify and according to our Spotify wrapped we combined for almost 300k minutes. Over the winter holidays after visiting an antique store in our local town we were introduced into the world of physical music. We would love to use the grant money for us buy a record player to fill our physical library with Liszt to Wes Montgomery. While you may be saying "a record player?" I understand that may sound very elementary which is why we came to devise a plan to connect Bluetooth headphones to the record player using usb amp which would allow us to connect it to a Bluetooth receiver to transmit signals to our headphones so we can enjoy the high quality records with high quality headphones to preserve the experience. But also to challenge ourselves using the knowledge we received from our programming classes we seek to create an audio visualiser using the signals coming from the preamp to create a multi sensational experience. 

## Plan 

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

Step 1.) Gather the parts
Step 2.) Assemble vinyl to bluetooth rig
Step 3.) Program audio visualizer
Step 4.) Connect Pre Amp to computer to start processing audio signals
Step 5.) Take in the new music listening experience
