# Silent Disco

## Summary

What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
My partner and I are going to build a an audio visualizer setup for a silent disco project we are working on after finding inspiration from the internet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FcszEPPI6c&t=55s. My Partner and I love listening to music. Often you can see on our discord statuses us listening to Spotify and according to our Spotify wrapped we combined for almost 300k minutes. Together we hope to relax and listen to music in a new sensory experience.

## Plan 

What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?

Step 1.) Gather the parts
Step 2.) Create the light rig and mod the headphones
Step 3.) Use audio visualizer program found https://github.com/IzzyBrand/ledvis
Step 4.) Connect RPI to the led strips and have them run the audio visualizer code
Step 5.) Take in the new music listening experience
